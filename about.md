Here are my **expectations** in exchange for my experience, skills, and time with you or your employer:\
I prefer fully remote opportunities and seek an interview process that concludes within a month. Since I am requesting a remote role, I am willing to make some concessions in my variable pay; however, my base salary is non-negotiable. I do not require benefits like health insurance, but I expect a minimum of 20 vacation days in addition to public holidays.
